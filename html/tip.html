					Digital nomads are people who are location-independent and use technology to perform their job, living a nomadic
					lifestyle. Digital nomads work remotely, telecommuting rather than being physically present at a company's
					headquarters
					or office. The digital nomad lifestyle has been made possible through several innovations, including content
					management
					software, cheap Internet access through WiFi, smartphones, and Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) to contact
					clients
					and employers. In addition, the growth of a gig economy has played a role, too.</p>

	<h1>How to Become a Digital Nomad: 7 Useful Tips</h1>
		<p>Many of us have seen those digital nomad images of a laptop next to a coconut, a gorgeous ocean in the background and
		the hashtag #officeoftheday. The thought of working from the beach or a hammock in a tropical location can easily induce
		envy, especially if you’re sitting in a cubicle or working from home in your sweatpants.
		I’ve been a digital nomad for the last three years, so I know a lot about traveling the world while working remotely.
		I’ve been to 49 countries, made many friends along the way and had amazing experiences as a nomad traveler.
		Here are some of the most important things to think about when you’re considering how to become a digital nomad,
		especially if you’re hoping to travel the world.
		Tips to start your digital nomad life
		1. Choose a city with a digital nomad community
		Having a community of nomads to connect with is crucial. When you’re thinking about a destination, there’s a lot to
		consider; if you go to a city that has an established nomad community, you'll more likely have built-in support.
		Medellin, Colombia, Playa Del Carmen, Mexico and Canggu, Bali are three popular digital nomad destinations, but there
		are many more. Do your research on Google and Reddit, and check which Facebook groups are available for your chosen
		city. You can get a lot of your destination-related questions answered before you commit to going there.

		2. Pick the right bank account and credit cards
		Bank account
		Some banks in the U.S. charge a fee when you use another bank's ATM. In turn, the other banks or ATMs may charge fees of
		their own. If you don’t select your bank wisely, you may be stuck paying two sets of ATM fees every time you withdraw
		cash.
		Save yourself the headache and choose a bank that reimburses ATM fees. Charles Schwab is a popular choice for digital
		nomad banking because it offers unlimited worldwide ATM fee rebates.
		Credit cards
		You’ll also want to get a travel credit card that doesn’t charge foreign transaction fees, which can be as high as 3%.
		There’s no reason to pay these if you don’t have to. Premium travel credit cards waive foreign transaction fees and also
		offer bonus points on certain categories (e.g., travel, dining, grocery purchases) and various perks for traveling.

		3. Decide what to do with your stuff
		If you want to be a digital nomad, the easiest scenario is to finish your apartment lease and store your stuff with
		family or at a storage facility. If your situation is more complicated, that doesn’t mean you’re out of luck.
		If you own your house or apartment, consider renting it out to a long-term tenant. Or if your city allows home-sharing,
		like Airbnb or VRBO, consider hiring someone to manage that process for you. This can be a great way to reduce your
		overhead costs and potentially make a profit.
		4. Choose a location that aligns with your working hours
		If you have a U.S.-based remote job (or clients), you’d have the easiest time working from locations that have
		overlapping time zones with the U.S. Avoid destinations like Asia, where the time difference can easily be 10 to 12
		hours, making it very difficult to have any sort of social life or a healthy routine in addition to work.
		5. Consider your technology requirements
		SIM card (phone)
		If you have a phone plan with a U.S. provider, chances are you’ll have to pay a lot for roaming internationally or your
		data will be capped at a lower speed after you've exhausted your free international data allowance.
		A common travel hack is to buy a prepaid SIM card with a data plan at your international destination. Store your
		existing SIM card in a safe place and insert the local SIM card into your phone. This can sometimes be as cheap as
		around $7 for 4 gigabytes of data, and can include free WhatsApp, social media and, with some plans, local calling.
		This is a much better option than constantly keeping your phone on airplane mode and searching for a Wi-Fi network.
		That's just not a sustainable solution when you're living abroad as a digital nomad (as opposed to being a vacationer).
		VPN (computer)
		If you’re going to live and work abroad, purchase a Virtual Private Network from a reliable provider (there are many). A
		VPN will make it easier for you to log in to U.S.-based sites, not to mention watch Netflix and other streaming services
		(which may not be available in the country you’re visiting).
		6. Get travel insurance
		Depending on where you travel to, local healthcare may be relatively inexpensive compared to coverage in the U.S.
		However, still consider purchasing travel insurance or travel medical insurance in case you experience an emergency.
		Most U.S.-based insurance plans do not cover you internationally.

		7. Join co-living communities
		If you’ve done all the research, but still feel nervous about taking the leap on your own, consider joining a
		co-living/co-working community. There are several well-known companies that run coordinated gatherings that range in
		length from one month to one year in various parts of the world.
		If you’re interested, you’ll need to submit an application. Usually, they cater to aspiring or existing remote workers
		and entrepreneurs who want to make friends while living and working abroad.
		You can have a real career as a digital nomad
		Due to the pandemic, working remotely has become more normalized, shifting the nomad scene into the mainstream. A common
		misconception of the digital nomad lifestyle is that people who do this are sacrificing financial stability or have
		shady jobs. That is not the case.
		The last year has demonstrated that many of us can work from our laptops without needing to step foot into an office.
		And there are plenty of remote work job search sites that list a variety of open positions.
		If you already have a job you love, consider asking your boss to let you work remotely permanently. You’ll need to have
		a salient argument and assure the company that your performance won’t suffer. You'll be well on your way to working
		remotely while traveling the world.
