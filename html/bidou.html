				Digital nomads are people who are location-independent and use technology to perform their job, living a nomadic
				lifestyle. Digital nomads work remotely, telecommuting rather than being physically present at a company's headquarters
				or office. The digital nomad lifestyle has been made possible through several innovations, including content management
				software, cheap Internet access through WiFi, smartphones, and Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) to contact clients
				and employers. In addition, the growth of a gig economy has played a role, too.</p>

						<p class="text1"><strong>Understanding Digital Nomads</strong> </br>
						The term digital nomad was coined in 1997 in a book called The Digital Nomad, written by Tsugio Makimoto and David
						Manners. Their book prophesized the invention of a singular, all-powerful communication device that would allow
						employees the ability to work from anywhere, among other hypotheses.
						
						In the 21st century, digital nomads use their skills to work via laptops, social media, and mobile phones. Digital
						nomads might spend a few months working from a beach community in Costa Rica and then another few months in a part-time
						share in London or Rome. The freedom to choose where to live and work is part of the benefit of being a digital nomad.
						The rise in short-term home and office shares available worldwide via online platforms means it is easier than ever to
						book a stay for a few days, weeks, or months.
						
						While being a digital nomad sounds appealing, there are downsides. Although the location may be majestic, the available
						work may not always use your skills to the fullest or pay all that well. So, to maintain a digital nomad's lifestyle,
						you may actually work harder for less pay compared to a traditional office job. The rise in remote work and job
						opportunities has made it easier for workers to try out a digital nomad lifestyle while earning income and building a
						career.
						
						However, the best way to make being a digital nomad a reality is to have a stream of passive income to supplement the
						contract work you'll be picking up on your travels. This removes some of the financial pressure not to spend your entire
						time abroad staring at your screen.

						<p class="text"> <strong>Who Are the Digital Nomads?</strong> </br>
						Digital nomads tend to be younger people and can be found working in most industries in the knowledge economy:
						marketing, design, IT, writing, media, tutoring, and consulting. According to a 2020 study by MBO Partners, there are
						10.9 million digital nomads in the U.S. alone, and 19 million more Americans reported they are considering a digital
						nomad lifestyle.
						
						Digital nomads may either be remote employees or knowledge process outsourcing employees. Although most telecommuters
						and freelancers are technically digital nomads, the term is most often used to describe people living or traveling
						abroad or domestically while working. Some digital nomads have a wide range of clients and make a living through the
						combination of jobs, while others have formal or semi-formal agreements with clients guaranteeing a certain amount of
						work or billable hours.
						
						Outsite is an online community of digital nomads that provides access to coliving/coworking, plus offers services to
						support remote workers. Outsite reports the average age of their members is 35 years old, and 65% of members were either
						single or divorced</p>
						</br>
						<p class="text"><strong>When Digital Nomads Settle Down</strong> </br>
						Many digital nomads eventually end uprooted to their home offices. When the wandering is over, the client portfolio a
						digital nomad has developed often sets up the transition to being a full-time freelancer from whatever local they
						choose. If a digital nomad is strategic about the location, they can leverage currency and cost of living differences to
						find a locale where the dollars they earn go much further, reducing the amount they need to work. Some digital nomads
						stay put after starting a family, and others take their families with them, joining other like-minded travelers with
						children</p>
						</br>
						<p class="text"><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages of Being a Digital Nomad</strong> </br>
						Digital nomads are often individuals who want to have freedom and flexibility with the jobs and time to travel. Digital
						nomads often live a minimal existence rich in experiences versus physical objects. They get to explore new cultures by
						putting down temporary roots in many locations each year. Digital nomad lifestyles are not for everyone. If you can't
						earn enough on the road, you may find yourself broke without the money to return home.
						
						You may have to work non-traditional hours and juggle multiple clients. Digital nomads must have access to reliable
						internet and work and meet deadlines in different time zones. Some digital nomads report feeling lonely on the road
						without family or close friends, and it may be hard to form long-term relationships. It may be expensive to buy travel
						health insurance, and even if medical care in some countries is cheaper than in the U.S.
						</br>
						Pros</br>
						
						1 Freedom from traditional office settings</br>
						
						2 Opportunities to travel and learn about new cultures</br>
						
						3 Time to engage in outdoor hobbies like surfing</br>
						
						4 More control over your own time
						</br>
						Cons</br>
						1 Can be expensive to travel on a regular basis</br>
						
						2 You may have to work for clients in multiple time zones</br>
						
						3 Loneliness or isolation from family and friends</br>
						
						4 Must be highly organized for ultimate life/work balance on the road</p>
